Build a Shopping Kart API
--------------------------

Requirements will grow over time but to start:

We are starting a shop that sells a few things. 
Customers will get smart-trolleys which they can add their products to, 
and get a total printed on their screen.


Here is the price list:

Chocolate Bar £1
Box of Cornflakes £1.75
Bottle of OJ £2.

Please write a simple program for now that can take a price list, and then
allow customers to add one or more items to their trolleys and have the total continually
update.

Don't worry about the UI for now, just an API that does the right thing.
